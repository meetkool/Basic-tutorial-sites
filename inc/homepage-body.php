			<div class="home-content">
				<p>The purpose of this website is to help all users enhance their knowledge of what Unix is and how it works. This website consists of multiple quizzes to put your intelligence to the test, an extensive amount of commands and short summaries on how they work, and an interactive terminal where users may enter commands and see how each of them work first hand. This website contains information that users of all levels of Unix experience will have access to. Users could use this website as an introduction/tutorial to Unix and have a brief idea of the beginner commands, while others might just use this to brush up and expand their knowledge base of the operating system. Hopefully, you will be satisfied and have a better grasp of Unix by the end of your visit!</p>

				<h4>What is</h4>
                <h2>Linux/Unix?</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="home-content">
				<p>Linux and Unix are both operating systems but one is a little more known over the other. Linux is more commonly used than Unix mainly because it’s open source and free, which means all users can modify and redistribute the original source code to their own preference. Also, Linux is a bit more known because it is used in hardware and software, game development, and tablet PCs. While Unix is not free and mainly runs on a Command Line Interface, making it less flexible than Linux, and limiting the compatibility with different types of hardware. While Unix is used more toward the internet such as, Intel, HP, and internet servers. Since Unix is not free, you do not have full access to its source code and cannot sell your specific version. As where Linux, is free to download and can be distributed through all sorts of publicity.</p>

				<h2>History</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="home-content">
				<p>Unix began back in the 1960’s from AT&amp;T bell labs. This was involved into a project with MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and General Electric for a time-sharing system called Multiplexed Information and computing service (Multics). Later on, Bell Labs pulled out if the Multics project because it did not meet up to their standards. During the 1970’s a new operating system was organized without a name but later on named Unics (Uniplexed Information and computing service). A man named Ken Thompson worked on his own operating system in 1969 on the PDP-7, which later developed with a hierarchical file system, command line interpreter and some other utility programs. The computing Sciences Research center desired to use the Unix program but needed a word processor. Thompson later on added text processing capabilities to Unix.</p>
